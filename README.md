Free Code Camp Tribute Page for Radical Edward

notes:
ED: Edward. A net diver from Earth.

Jet lands in an abandoned train station to gather information. Jet
approaches a hippy.

HIPPY: That's probably Ed, man. I hear he's a huge guy, 2 meters tall. Supposedly, he used to be a basketball player.

Jet approaches an Indian man.

INDIAN MAN: Yeah, I know Ed. Radical Edward. I hear she's a very beautiful yet whimsical hacker.

Jet approaches an old man.

OLD MAN: No, no, that hacker is a child. A brat that loves horrible pranks, I hear.

Jet approaches a middle-aged woman.

WOMAN: Oh, what I heard from the lady next door is that that hacker is gay.

Jet approaches a little kid holding boxes.

KID: Hacker? You mean Ed? He's an alien! That's what everyone says!

Jet gives up.

When referring to Edward's gender in a 2017 interview, Cowboy Bebop director Shinichirō Watanabe said, "[Edward's] gender is meaningless, we don't need it.

SATELLITE: Earth?

ED: Yup, Hey, what's your name?

SATELLITE: I am the satellite control program on the D-135 artificial
           satellite.

ED: What's that? Don't you have a nickname? Then Ed will give you one. I
    know! Because you're a computer, you can be MPU! MPU! Cool name!

MPU: Um...

ED: Ed is Edward Wong Hau Pepelu Tivrusky IV. Ed for short! Nice to meet
    you!


Back on the Bebop. Jet places a Piyoko on the living room table.

JET: Here. A souvenir from Earth.

SPIKE: Is this food?

FAYE: It makes me doubt that they have any sense.

JET: Unlike you, I learned some information. They said that an unknown
hacker named Radical Edward is the suspicious one.

FAYE: It doesn't mean anything if he's unknown.

JET: I know, more or less.

Spike feeds the Piyoko to Ein.

SPIKE: It seems okay.

FAYE: What kinda thing is it?

Faye reaches for the Piyokos. Jet takes the box away.

JET: 2 meters tall. Ex-basketball player. Beautiful kid. And on top of it,
a gay alien.

“Radical Edward's profile: he's a seven foot ex basketball pro, hindu, guru, drag queen, alien!”

Edward built a reputation as a hacker, earning the nickname "Radical Edward." Many people had stories of who she really was – an alien, a basketball player, a 3-year old.
