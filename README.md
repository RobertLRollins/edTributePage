This fan club site started as the freeCodeCamp Tribute Page project but quickly became more. I wanted a project that I could pour myself into for a couple of weeks to solidify what I had leaned so far in HTML/CSS. It also alowed me to delve deeper and learn more.

My focus with this project was to design and develope a simple yet attractive website in a reasonable time frame. I keep the scope of the project in check as it seemed to want keep growing.

Another focus was on readable well organized code and files. These are some of the largest files I have created so far and it was a challenge to manage them.
